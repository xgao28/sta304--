Hi, this is Xinxiang's website. I am in group 43.

First of all, I learned quarto docs (qmd) files that we can use markdown and code at the same time. Moreover, qmd files are versatile since it can handle lots of languages, like [@citeR], python, and so on, which makes "bilingual" coders comfortable with ipynb and rmd files happier.

Moreover, in @tellingstories, our professor elaborates on the usage of quarto files. Make sure to take a look if interested!
