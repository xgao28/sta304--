Moreover, qmd files are versatile since it can handle lots of languages, like (R Core Team 2021), python, and so on, which makes “bilingual” coders comfortable with ipynb and rmd files happier.\nMoreover, in Alexander (2023), our professor elaborates on the usage of quarto files. Make sure to take a look if interested!\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman; Hall/CRC. https://tellingstorieswithdata.com.\n\n\nR Core Team. 2021.
